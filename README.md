# Burger-Eater
A virtual burger eating application utilizing handlebars, express.js, node.js, and the MVC architecture 

## Table of Contents 

## Objective 
The objective of this application is to showcase my use of the MVC architecture utilizing GET, POST, PUT, & Delete methods.



## Code Structure
Since I did utilize the MVC architecture.  To simply put it, once the user makes a request, the request is sent to the controller, the controller then calls the model, the model calls the ORM to gather the relevant data, the model then sends a response to the controller, the controller sends the response to the views, and the views displays the response to the user.
